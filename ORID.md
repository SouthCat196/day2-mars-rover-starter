**What did I learn**

1. Unit Testing
    1. Why Unit Testing: Cost control, Quick feedback, Safety net, Code documentation
    2. Benefits of Unit Testing: Test description, Given, When, Then
2. TDD (Test-Driven Development)
    1. Why TDD: Benefits of writing tests early, Simple design, Refactoring in time
    2. What did we do: Red → Green → Refactor

**What activities did I do**

1. Standup Meeting
2. Code Review
3. Drawing and passing brain-stimulating games
4. TDD Practice: MarsRover

**Scenes that left a deep impression on me**

1. During business clarification, I mentioned many important points, and the instructor suggested that I might have searched for information online.

**R: The weather has turned cold, making me uncomfortable.**

**I:**

- During Code Review, because I was very detailed in reviewing the code, I realized that there were many areas of improvement in my own code. The "aha" moment for me was: I had always thought my code was perfect and didn’t need any optimization.
- Initially, I was skeptical about TDD, thinking it wouldn’t make a significant difference for me. However, when I was doing the MarsRover classroom exercise, while others had passed all the test cases, I was still struggling with how to design my functionality better. I realized my progress was lagging far behind, and that’s when I started to appreciate the power of TDD.
- The MarsRover requirements were similar to some algorithm problems. During business clarification, I mentioned some more complex points, but when the instructor guessed that I had found the information online, I noticed the students in the last two rows looking at me with what seemed like questioning expressions. It made me feel very uncomfortable, as if I had done something wrong. Later, I communicated with the instructor to clear up my concerns. It turns out that searching for information online was not wrong; it was just the way others looked at me that made me feel like I had made a mistake.

**D:**

- Standup Meetings should follow the ORID framework, including reporting on what needs to be done or improved today.
- Don’t believe that your code is already perfect and stop reviewing it. There’s always room for improvement—more reviews lead to more discoveries.
- In time-constrained tasks, you should first implement a simple design, rather than over-focusing on unnecessary code design.
- In the future, I should be more confident and stick to what I believe is the right thing to do.



Finally, I would like to thank coach Shangqi for his guidance and communication.
